# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I made this as part of the prework. I'm pretty sure I have to turn it in when this is done, but this was a nice opportunity to mess around with github issues and set up SSH keys.

## Installation

## Usage

View the site [here](https://sprocketcreations.github.io/prework-study-guide/). It contains notes about the prework, divided into boxes. You can open the console with F12 to view the Javascript stuff in action.
